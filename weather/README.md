# NOAA's National Weather Service API

Welcome to the weather data playground!

This section provides a ready-to-use `Producer` and `Subscriber` so that you can start ingesting and using all kinds of weather data, using Ensign to store the realtime data streams on your behalf.

We have options for both Python üêç and Golang.

All you need to get started is a free Ensign API key, which you get by creating an account [here](https://rotational.app/register).
