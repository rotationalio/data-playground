# Ensign Data Playground

Welcome to our data playground! Our Data Playground is a safe place to explore, experiment, and collaborate with real time streaming data. We've curated a variety of data sources, examples, and sample code to help you get started.

Like all playgrounds we have a few rules:

1. **Experiment**: Have fun experimenting. Don't worry, you won't break anything.
2. **Collaborate**: Make friends. Set up new projects with them. We're all in this together.
3. **Share**: Excited about something you've built? Let us know and we'll showcase it!

**NOTE** The license defined in this repository only refers to the license of the source code, not of the data sets or API usage themselves. Please ensure that you respect the data license of the APIs that you use with the codebase.

## Getting Started

Each of the directories in this repository is a self-contained data-source. Ususally this means that there is code to create and run publishers that ingest API from a data source and publish it to an Ensign topic ready for you to consume in real-time using Ensign subscribers. To learn how to use each data source, click on the README of each project.
