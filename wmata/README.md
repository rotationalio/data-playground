# Real-time Metro Data from WMATA

Connect to DC Metro public transport data and start experimenting with scheduling models and apps.

This folder contains ready-to-use `Producers` and `Subscribers` so that you can start ingesting and using all kinds of metro data, using Ensign to store the realtime data streams on your behalf.

We have options for both Python 🐍 and Golang.

All you need to get started is a free Ensign API key, which you get by creating an account [here](https://rotational.app/register).
